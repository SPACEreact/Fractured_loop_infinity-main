# Camera Movement Notes - Day 5

## 1. Slow Push-In
- What it is: The camera slowly moves closer to the subject, usually in a straight line (dolly or track in).
- Effect: Builds tension or draws the audience into a character’s internal world. Creates intimacy or anxiety.
- Used in: Emotional realizations, suspenseful moments.
- Example: In Interstellar, when Cooper watches the video messages from Earth — slow push-in adds emotional weight.

## 2. Creep-Out
- What it is: A slow backward camera movement, often away from a character.
- Effect: Makes the subject feel isolated, distant, or lost in their environment. Adds a haunting or reflective vibe.
- Mood: Loneliness, detachment, revelation.
- Think: The world keeps moving but the character is stuck.

## 3. The Moment
- What it is: Not a movement, but a concept — “The Moment” refers to the emotional or narrative peak in a scene. Camera moves are used to highlight it.
- Camera behavior: Often a slow push-in, or a steady lock on the actor’s face. Sometimes silence + stillness.
- Goal: Let the actor carry it. Don’t distract.

## 4. Distraction
- What it is: A purposeful use of movement, composition, or visual elements to mislead or redirect the audience’s focus.
- Camera trick: Pan or rack focus to something irrelevant before revealing the real subject.
- Usage: Builds suspense, surprise, or contrast.
- Example: A character talks calmly, but in the background — a small, crucial movement hints something’s wrong.

## 5. The Candidate
- Refers to: A famous use of paranoid, slow zooms or wide shots from The Candidate (1972) and other political thrillers.
- Camera style: Wide frame, subject small and distant, often zooming or pulling back.
- Effect: Powerlessness, surveillance vibe. The system is watching. You're just a pawn.
- Mood: Paranoia, bureaucracy, loss of control.
